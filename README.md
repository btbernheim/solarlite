# Solarlite

##Inspiration
Two developers and one idea guy walk into a hackathon…..

Our inspiration to participate came from comradery formed while spending time together at Dev Bootcamp. We were passionate about embracing ambiguity and trying something new together. With merely pure faith we entered the SunCode Hackathon with an idea and 100% trust in one another’s abilities.

We all believe that renewable energy can revolutionize the world. What better way to contribute to solutions that reimagine our relationship with the planet than by being participants in an event dedicated to pioneering a new future.

##What it does
SolarLite is a global platform that leverages community & rewards to give homeowners the power to create a brighter world.

##What's next for Solarlite
We want to create a lot more functionality with our product. There were so many features we were unable to finish that we had to cut because of time.
