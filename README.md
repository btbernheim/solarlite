# Solarlite
A Suncode 2017 Hackathon Submission (Honorable Mention)

## Challenge:
Sunrun Challenge I: Reimagine the Solar Homeowner Experience. What are customers interested in knowing about? How do they want to interact with the system? How do we maximize value for both the customer and the solar company? At what point in the process do they want a portal? Create a demonstration portal.

## Inspiration
Two developers and one idea guy walk into a hackathon…..

Our inspiration to participate came from camaraderie formed while spending time together at Dev Bootcamp. We were passionate about embracing ambiguity and trying something new together. With merely pure faith we entered the SunCode Hackathon with an idea and 100% trust in one another’s abilities.

We all believe that renewable energy can revolutionize the world. What better way to contribute to solutions that reimagine our relationship with the planet than by being participants in an event dedicated to pioneering a new future.

## What it does
SolarLite is a global platform that leverages community & rewards to give homeowners the power to create a brighter world.

## What's next for Solarlite
We want to create a lot more functionality with our product. There were so many features we were unable to finish that we had to cut because of time.
